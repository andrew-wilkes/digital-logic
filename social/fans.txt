Dominik Nowak It has a potential to became game in type of Shenzhen I/O. You are given an input sygnal and your goal is to put and connect logic gates to match expected output. Games are great didactic tool. Also - It's a pity there were no tools like this when I was in my Technical Midschool.
Most of Zachtronics games are awsome. I got all of them and thinking about playing ExaPunks. I'm hesitating because of it's high addictiveness. When I was plying Shenzhen I/O my wife was laughing at me by saying: "you're playing in a game with manual in hand"

Cleber Alves Is it available for us to play?

Carl Ellam-Speed you should also look at tis-100 that I was introduced to last year. Its focus is on assembler programming and is VERY addictive game (trying to optimise based on performance and number of instructions).

Igor Cavour Oliveira i sugest calling the game Asic

Braeden Foster Oh this is sooo cool! I love programming with just logic gates!

Ilyas Taouaou Oh yeaa great. That's what i wanted!
